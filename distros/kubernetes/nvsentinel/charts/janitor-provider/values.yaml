# Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Configuration
# The janitor-provider module supports multiple cloud providers for node reboot operations
# Configure the appropriate CSP for your environment
csp:
  # CSP provider type (kind, kwok, aws, gcp, azure, oci, nebius)
  # - kind: For local development with kind clusters (simulated reboots)
  # - kwok: For testing with kwok (simulated nodes)
  # - aws: For AWS EKS clusters
  # - gcp: For Google Cloud GKE clusters
  # - azure: For Microsoft Azure AKS clusters
  # - oci: For Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OKE clusters
  # - nebius: For Nebius Managed Kubernetes (MK8s) clusters
  provider: "kind"
