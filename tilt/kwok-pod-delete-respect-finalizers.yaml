# KWOK Stage to make pod deletion respect finalizers
# By default, KWOK deletes pods immediately regardless of finalizers.
# This stage overrides that behavior to only delete pods when:
# 1. deletionTimestamp is set (deletion requested)
# 2. finalizers are empty (all finalizers removed)
#
# Reference: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kwok/discussions/926
