/*
In the code coverage report, this file is contributing 0%. Reason is since the healthEvents message send
by the gpu health monitor is received by function HealthEventOccuredV1 and in order to test the functionality
completely, we need simulate the queue enqueue and dequeue operations along with initializing the
PlatformConnectorServer. it will get really complex.Hence, ignoring this file as part of unit testing for now.
